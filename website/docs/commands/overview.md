# Overview of API Coverage

Garnet supports a large (and growing) subset of the Redis REST API surface. The list is growing over time, and we would love to hear from you on what APIs you want the most! Also, we want to see you contribute new APIs as well.

Garnet also supports a powerful custom operator framework whereby you can register custom C# data structures and read-modify-write operations on the server and access them via an extension of RESP.

View the full list of commands and their support status in the [API Compatibility](api-compatibility.md) section.
