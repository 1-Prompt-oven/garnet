# Introduction to Tsavorite

Garnetâ€™s storage layer, called Tsavorite, was forked from our prior open-source project [FASTER](https://github.com/microsoft/FASTER). Tsavorite includes strong database features such as thread scalability, 
tiered storage support (memory, SSD, and cloud storage), fast non-blocking checkpointing, recovery, operation logging for durability, multi-key [locking](locking.md) and transaction support, and better 
memory management and [space reuse](reviv.md).
